# WLP4 Compiler

WLP4 is a simplified version of C that includes procedures, integers, pointers, arrays, arithmetic and boolean expressions, conditional statements and loops. This WLP4 Compiler implements scanning using the Simplified Maximal Munch algorithm, parsing using the SLR(1) parsing algorithm, context sensitive analysis, and code generation from WLP4 to the MIPS assembly language. The source code for this project is not public, but is available upon request (please email ajdmello@uwaterloo.ca).
